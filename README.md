# SillyTavern Group Utilities

This extension helps group chats by providing more context to the AI using system notes. It shares the first sentence of both description and personality of all chat members (except the generating character) as a part of the prompt, seemlessly giving the AI knowledge of all other characters within the chat.

## Features

- Shared Character Information
- Highly Configurable

## Installation and Usage

### Installation

Use ST's inbuilt extension installer. 

### Usage

Configure it within the extensions tab, aside from that this will only activate within group chats!
